# stonks

This repo is a project I'm working on for stock analysis, in Pyhton, using Alpha Vantage as the data source.

* stonks.py -- library defining the class, used by other programs.
* basics.py -- dumps out overview information on stocks listed on command line.
* fscore.py -- reports Piotrosky f-score for stocks listed on command line.
